# data_validation
This script is used to compare data from csv exports of different sources.
Using a column mapping table to columns 1 to 1 it will iterate over rows to find missing
records between the sources and also output how much overlap there is in the data not included in a primary key.

Would be even more useful with the implementation of a method to output the delta of numeric columns.
